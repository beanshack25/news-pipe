## Overview
### Explanation
Our goal is to create a (for-now) simple web-application that can link news events of importance in a tree, to other
events that precede and follow after it.
### Use-Cases
We have two primary situations we're considering:
1. **Extremely complex topics spanning vast amounts of information and events.** Consider for example
a crisis on a country, or a war affecting some number of participants. We hope to create an application
that can allow people to see the events that resulted in the current state of the situation by viewing prior
events in a tree format, and getting brief synopses on each of them.
2. **Links of interest.** Say there is an event that someone may be interested in, for whatever reason.
They may then be interested to know the various events that resulted or spawned because of this. For example,
someone may be aware that a company in the USA bought a large number of properties in some area of a city - 
our app should hopefully be able to indicate to people the wider effects of that decision.
